# [Find The Parity Outlier](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5526fc09a1bbd946250002dc/train/python)

You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.
